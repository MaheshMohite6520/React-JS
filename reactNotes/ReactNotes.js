//! npm :

// It is a package manager.
// It will download all the packages & libraries in system means we are downloading packages and then we can use them.
// Installation size will be around 500 to 600 MB.

//! npx :

// It stands for Node Package Executer.
// It will download only the necessary packages & remaining packages we can access without downloading them.
// Ex. If we want use Facebook in Mobile Phone, we have 2 ways :
// 1] Downloading Facebook App which is similar with npm way, means we are downloading & then only we are using it.
// 2] Downloading the browser(neccesary package) is similar with npx way, Here we are not downloading the Facebook App but instead we are downloading neccesary package(Browser) & executing or using Facebook App on that package.
// Installation size will be around 300 to 400 MB.

// To install : npx create react app projectname

// Project name should be in lower case only.

// Folder Structure :

// 1] node_modules
// 2] public
// 3] src
// 4] .gitignore
// 5] package-lock.json
// 6] package.json
// 7] Readme.md

// To start the App : npm start
// Default port : 3000
// We can create js & jsx file.
// We can write JSX inside both .jsx & .js file & JavaScript inside .js & .jsx both file.

//! npm create vite :

// Installation size will be around 55 to 65 MB.
// To start the App : npm run dev
// Default port : 5173
// We can create js & jsx file.

//! Hot Module Replacement (HMR) :

// It is one of the most useful feature offered by the package bundlers in React.
// It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh.
// HMR is not intended to use in production(after development), meaning it should pnly be used in development.

//! Features of React :

//! 1] React follows Component Based Architecture.
// Ex. Daigram (Landing Page)

//! 2] React is Declarative in Nature.
// Everything is declared internally, we are just using it.
// Ex. We don't need to write or use any DOM methods beacause everything is decared with JSX.
// We can call React as Declarative cause it provides many in-Built Hooks for different functionalities.
// Imperative means we have to create it first & then use it.
