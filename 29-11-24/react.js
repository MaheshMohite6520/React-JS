//! <--------------------- React-JS Introduction ----------------->

//! 1] Library :

// Library is a collection of reusable block of code.
// Libraries are light weight.
// Libraries are loosely typed.
// Libraries are always particular functional oriented.
// Using libraries we can create fast & scalable applications.
// The applications which are developed by using library are easy to debug.
// We can use multiple external libraries.
// Ex: React
// It focuses on front end development only.

//! 2] Framework :

// Framework is a collection of library.
// Frameworks are heavy weight.
// Frameworks are strictly typed.
// Framework focuses on multiple functionality.
// If we need any external packages or libraries then we can install them.
// The application developed by using Frameworks will be slow as compare to the Library applications.
// The applications which are developed by using framework are hard to debug.
// Ex. Next JS
// It focuses on front end as well as backend development.

//! Single Page Applications :

// The applications which does not require the page reload for updating the page content.
// Usually single page applications contain only one HTML file.
// Single page applications are faster than Multi-page applications.
// AJAX is the Hero of Single page applications.

//! AJAX ( Asynchronous JavaScript And XML ) :

// AJAX will send only the necessary request to the server. So that bandwidth will be very very less & beacause of that your request responce cycle will becames very very faster & ultimately your application becames faster.
// It will bundel the all requestinto individual bundles based on the extension.
// Package bundles will help ues to reduce the Bandwidth.
// If you are sending n number of request from the frontend that multiple requests are bundeled into as minimum number of requests as possible based on their extension by package bundler so that Bandwidth will be reduced.

//! Bandwidth :

// It is number of request & response cycle per second.
// As minimum is your bandwidth that much of fast your application.

//! Steps to create React JS Project :

// 1] Download Node js & add path to Environment variables.
// 2] Check in CMD if it is installed or not by using 'node -v'
// 3] Create an empty folder and open CMD
// 4] use 'npm create vite'
// 5] Enter Y
// 6] Enter project name without any white space
// 7] Enter package name ( optional )
// 8] Select React and Enter
// 9] Select Plane JavaScript & Enter
// 10] Use below commands one by one :
// cd firstInstallation
// npm install
// npm run dev
// 11] Search on browser 'http://localhost:5173/'
