//! main.jsx :

//! 1] createRoot :

// It is a method which is used to create rot element.
// It will take document.getElementById("root") as an argument.

//! 2] render :

// It is similar to the append().
// It is used to add the all componenets to a single div in index.html
// At the time of rendering Transpillation happens.

//! Component :

// It is nothing but an function which returns HTML elements.
// We have to follow Pascal case naming conventions while writing the componenets.

//! WorkFlow :

// All the files at the end will be imported into App.jsx.
// So if we import index.css inti App.jsx then the css will be applied to App.jsx as well as its child componenets or imported componenets also.
// It will not apply to the parent componenets or its siblings.
